## How to contribute to SuiteCRM


### **Code of Conduct**

This project and all community members are expected to upload the [SuiteCRM Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

#### **Bug Reporting**

* **Please do not open a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability**, and instead email us at security@suitecrm.com. This will be delivered to the product team who handle security issues. Please don't disclose security bugs publicly until they have been handled by the security team.

* Your email will be acknowledged within 24 hours during the business week (Mon - Fri), and youâ€™ll receive a more detailed response to your email within 72 hours during the business week (Mon - Fri) indicating the next steps in handling your report.

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/salesagility/SuiteCRM/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue that relates to your problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/salesagility/SuiteCRM/issues/new). Please be sure to follow the issue template as much as possible.

* **Ensure that the bug you are reporting is a core SuiteCRM issue** and not specific to your individual setup. For these types of issues please use the [Community Forum](https://www.suitecrm.com/forum/suite-forum).

#### **Did you fix a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description follows the template as much as possible.

* Before submitting, check if the bug is specific to hotfix branch, and if not, submit the PR to the hotfix-7.8.x branch.

#### **Did you create a new feature or enhancement?**

* Changes that can be considered a new feature or enhancement should be made to the develop branch instead of the hotfix or hotfix-7.8.x. branch.


Thanks!
